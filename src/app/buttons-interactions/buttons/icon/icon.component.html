MatIconRegistry is an injectable service that allows you to associate icon names with SVG URLs, HTML strings and to define aliases for CSS font classes.
<br><br>Note:
  In order to guard against XSS,
  any SVG URLs and HTML strings passed to the MatIconRegistry must be marked as trusted by using Angular's DomSanitizer service.</p>
